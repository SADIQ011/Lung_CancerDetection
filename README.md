# Lung_CancerDetection
In this project I have used KNN & decision tree 
algorithms to predict the accuracy of cancer. 

In this project I have used scikit-learn libraries like 
sklearn and pandas to predict and classify the dataset 
of lung cancer patients.

Slicing the dataset and feature scaling options are used 
to train the dataset. After that I have used a confusion 
matrix, f1 score and accuracy score to predict the 
accuracy of the result.
